The Plague of Justinian

The Plague of Justinian hit humanity between 541 and 542 AD. 
It is held responsible for the highest number of lives lost in any epidemic in history.
 Estimates believe 100 million people died during this time which was half the world population! 
This plague was able to spread so quickly because it was carried on the backs of rodents, 
whose fleas were infected with the bacteria. 
These rats traveled all over the world on trading ships and helped spread the infection from China to Northern Africa and all over the Mediterranean.
 The Plague of Justinian is attributed with having weakened the Byzantine Empire in several ways.
 The military lost power and was no longer able to fend off intruders.
 Farmers became sick, and agricultural production declined. 
With a smaller agricultural base, incoming taxes declined. 
Thousands of people died daily. An epidemic of this proportion has never again occurred although,
 in the 1300’s, the world was faced with another plague.

The Black Plague

The Black Plague claimed the lives of 50 million people from 1346 to 1350.
 The outbreak began in Asia and, once again, was carried throughout the world by rats covered with infected fleas. 
After its arrival in Europe, it spread death and destruction.
 Europe lost 60% of its population to the Black Death. 
Symptoms of this disease began with swelling of the lymph nodes, either in the groin, armpit or neck. 
After 6 to 10 days of infection and sickness, 80% of infected people die. 
The infection was spread via blood and airborne particles. 
This epidemic changed the course of European history. 
The lack of understanding of the origin of the disease led the Christian population to blame the Jewish population of poisoning the water wells,
 as a result of this accusation, thousands of Jews were killed.
 Others believed it was punishment dealt from Heaven for leading sinful lives.
 The world saw agricultural shortages as in the Plague of Justinian and malnutrition, and hunger was rampant. 
After the ending of the Black Death, the decline in population resulted in increased wages and cheap land.
 The available land was used for animal husbandry and meat consumption throughout the region increased.
 Since then, the world has seen epidemics caused by flu and cholera, but none claimed the number of lives of the 3rd worst epidemic in history: HIV/AIDS.

HIV/AIDS

The HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1960 and continue to present day although the scariest moments happened during the 1980’s when the world became informed of its existence. So far, this virus has caused the death of 39 million people. By the 1980’s, HIV was believed to infect somebody on every continent and in the US, the gay population was hit the hardest. Rare lung infections, rapidly advancing cancers, and unexplained immune deficiencies were rampant among gay men and at the time, doctors believed it was caused by same-sex activity. A large number of Haitians were also carriers of the virus which were not named until 1982. Cases were identified in Europe and Africa, in 1983, it was discovered that transmission occurred via heterosexual activities as well. Medicine for treatment was not available until 1987. Today, there are about 37 million people living with HIV. For those individuals with access to antiretroviral medicines, life expectancy has been extended. Currently, this virus is particularly aggressive in Sub-Saharan Africa where at least 68% of all global HIV/AIDS infections are found. The reasons for this are many but stem from poor economic conditions and little to no sex education.
